# Mario-Java-Greenfoot
I made a basic Mario game in Java using Greenfoot. So basically Greenfoot. is an IDE of Java, in which you can drag and drop or add objects, and directly code on how they act. Coming to Mario Game, we alll are familiar about what mario is, making this game super exciting, will work on more levels later but for now helping you all to learn.
